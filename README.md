The program is a text-based game where players will select options to further the story. There are five chapters with a variety of actions the players can choose. Each choice can have the effect of changing the story. The story starts towards the beginning of a zombie outbreak. The player takes the role of a survivor trying to get to safety in the city where the military is sending rescue teams. Depending on the player’s choices, they will succeed in reaching the city and be rescued or will be eaten by the undead. 
The code is hosted on Python Anywhere by Anaconda. There are no external services. The programming language used for the game is Python. The requirement for the system is the ability to run Python 3.7 or above. The game was written on Python 3.9. A Python environment is also required such as IDLE, web server, or Microsoft Visual Studio. 
Each chapter is on a different file. The functions are named simply as “Chapter_1”, “Chapter_2”, “Chapter_3”, “Chapter_4”, and "Chapter_5”. The architecture is arranged by providing background of where the story is. Then the list of options for the player to choose from is presented. The player selects their choice and the game moves on to the next chapter.
